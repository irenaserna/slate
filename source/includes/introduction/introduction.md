# Introduction

Welcome to the GeoBuffer API!

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, JQuery, Node, PHP and Node! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


GeoBuffer is a modern platform for geospatial data. Born in the cloud, it is social, collaborative and team oriented.
